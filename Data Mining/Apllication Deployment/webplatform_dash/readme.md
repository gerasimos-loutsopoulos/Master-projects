# Diabetes Classification Web Application

This project is a web-based application built using the Dash framework. It predicts whether an individual has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements. The application allows users to interactively input data, view visualizations of the dataset, and receive classification results from a pre-trained machine learning model.

## Features

- **Diabetes Prediction**: Predicts the likelihood of diabetes using diagnostic data.
- **Interactive Sliders**: Allows users to adjust input parameters such as glucose level, BMI, and age.
- **Data Visualizations**: Displays histograms and scatter plots for understanding variable distributions and relationships.

## Usage

1. **Ensure All Necessary Files Are Present**:
   Before running the application, make sure the following files are in the project directory:
   - `diabetes.csv`: The dataset used for creating visualizations.
   - `model_diabetes.pickle`: The pre-trained machine learning model used for predictions.
   - `helper_dami.py`: A file containing the layout and helper functions for the application.
   - `main.py`: The main application file (this is the file you'll execute).

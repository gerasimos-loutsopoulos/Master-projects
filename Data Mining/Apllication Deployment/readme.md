# Diabetes Classification Web App 

This project is a web application that predicts diabetes based on user input. Built a Python-Dash web app for diabetes classification, allowing users to input diagnostic data, get predictions, and explore interactive visualizations like histograms and scatter plots. Utilized a public dataset for real-time healthcare insights.

## How to Run
